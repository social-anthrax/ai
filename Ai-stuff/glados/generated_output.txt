Hi there, this a generated output poem from the shakespeare machine. have fun! 

et me not be so.

CLEOPATRA	I am a bootless of the palers, as I shall be tongued.

LADY MACBETH	A pretty painter than a better deed,
	And this is the devise of mine own state,
	And therefore looks upon the chair, and to be speak,
	And so art thou the base and breed of thee,
	That thou hast better blested wild as they are stoop'd,
	That we have stood a colour to their loves,
	A preceding to the better of my life,
	Will not be bound to see mine honours.

LADY MACBETH	It was the boy: the present soul
	Of many too much made me thither,
	And so I should be served to the duke,
	That will be sorry, that myself are morned
	And then my sovereign, those that should be so.
	I have a son of that dispatch to thee,
	Whose likes are bound to spoke thy father's stars,
	And stands, and the better of thy blood
	Are bounded to the sea and truth to thee.
	And, be thou so many of this best black a battle beat,
	In that will break as well to speak to that,
	And with a body of this place, and the day
	Into a soul that strikes him stand and so deserve
	That we will pass his face to thee the base.
	Art thou a coursier to thy life and brother,
	The batter that the bones of married body
	And therein this, as thou art born and that we have,
	And then he hath a strength and body of mine eye
	That thou art such to be both born and strange,
	The sun and counterfeits that thou, that shall discharge
	As him a bastald of his service bears,
	A breeding out of bleeding to the sense af heaven
	And shall be brief, and so art strongly strike
	With him, and to be thundered and shall be the story,
	They should have seen the continuance of the state
	That thou hadst borne the streets of honour of my soul
	And still that thou art sort to be a child;
	And till the body of his blood are bound
	Thin should be the better than the courtier of the book
	I will not break the body of a counterfeit,
	Which burning his body as to arrove the soul,
	The courtesy, we shall be sentent to be cannot,--
	That they, his blood and pleasures, and his constant soul
	So farst the battle of his soul are break
	And stand the book of the desperate daughter, 	Which, by the sun of this disgrace of mine,
	That he did look of heaven and breathes to his books,
	That we shall strike their bones, and this dispatch,
	And so merry in that hath been bestow'd,
	With a barbaried best, as thou hast moved the world.

	[Thinks]

	There is a mercy of a battle at a strange season:
	If thou dost bring him to the bosom at the bargain of
	The world to be to the duke's possession,
	Which thou dost bring thee by the caure of her thoughts,
	That we will be as sure an ass of blessed body
	That should be stared to stand to thee and, both,
	That sometime the breath of their confounds,
	Which had best died, their loves that hot the books on treason
	Are therefore tell to thee and the revenge
	And changed without a service. Here come him,
	What, wilt thou see her father? Where is't there to be
	Talk'd to the stage of this tongue on the charge
	That with a batter is a base of bloody strength?
	Therefore bring him, thou art a banderous beauty,
	That where he had a bonder of this body brains
	To thick a dog, and hateful leaves, and start his body:
	There is a sharper princely soul of heaven;
	The bloody charge thou hast, which, in him to this sea,
	As he had spoke the course of the condition of men's bleed,
	And then I thank the foot of mine own pattern,
	And will be born a bottle took again.
	This is the country's bed; who cames to thee to the child;
	And what honour, to this dog, and heaven have broke
	To bear his country of his breath to the sea
	Which is to see thy latter true as heart
	As shall be stored, and be to death of thee,--
	The cardinal that this is chasted, as his body
	Were bust another to his chain,
	And will not stay and seem to the secret company:
	As hath a bastard, she says he is dangerous.

	[Exit]

ACT IV



SCENE IV	A room if this place.


	[Enter CLAUDIO and ADRIANA on the Toward]

LORD POLONIUS	Ay, my lord.

CLAUDIO	I was not so, I wish you all than there we may remember
	The better to myself, and to the blood
	Which he hath struck to seem his carriage,
	And strang her bearding on the battle of the soldiers,
	And stay and see the sea of this deceited back,
	And the discourse of merry, as I have a beard
	That I may see the body of a care of his
	As he hath seen the bond of the desige
	Of her contract and soldiers and his breast.
	That stands to the companion, and her fortunes
	Are true and comes the books of this.

	[Enter AARON]

	The king is not the coursesy of the book,
	Which though that both did lead themselves to do it,
	Till I content thee to the common traitur.
	When thou hast seen and be right to bego his house
	As thou hast seen the better to miscountentant
	Within the contrary of this thought term,
	As, to bestern my life, and time he can
	A bood of heavens where I would straight be come,
	Whisper the bond of the commended strokes,
	And that thou art not so much man that thinks
	That thou didst be rose and better seen
	To the compare of men, who comes to die:
	I will distrust the company of the strange things, 	And, too, as when his beards are but a cold,
	The country of the count of this common day
	We have the sea of this and blame a child, and she
	I would not look upon the body, to the senate of their shepherd,
	As thought he can be breath of his breast,
	And that thou canst not spare a both of him,
	As here in the sons' common beauty seal'd
	Wherein the secrets are better than
	Thou shalt not live to beauty thoughts.

LUCIUS	Ay, my good lord.

HOLATIO	Ay, my lord.

LADY CAPULET	Why, the good manners, therefore lie it this.

LAUNCE	And I have sent me to this barge of honesty:
	The princes are alone. Why, I have seen
	My life to strike thy brow that I may see
	As we did see the change to steal the common traitor.

LORD POLONIUS	The pain as so more, and, but he is not at home
	With the best poor batters, to the confined course
	Of the stately carden of miseries
	Are childed this be compered and to be remember'd.

DUMAIN	Though there be but a store of blames, more thought
	In charge, that I have spoke at words of misery:
	I am not so more than the storm of mine,
	That thou hast satiefly but mine.

CLAUDIO	Nay, I'll the constant thoughts of men
	As which I say the point of many months,
	I have as firety as an ole and sure
	Though they are burned to all. By my power,
	Who should not be a strong believe to be the cause?
	That I may stay to tell me, I am strange for me.

	[Trempitien]

	With thee attended thee to thee and there
	We have to speak this base, which is not so 
	Though thou art such a body of my land,
	An hour of this disgraced boy of brow,
	The bones that should not speak with the streets of the duke,
	Who come to the case, we see the strength after
	The crown the contents of the sea
	And that I see the strong and chief of mine,
	We have been born the company.

MACBETR	And I am best before thee, for tho condition
	Is to my lord of thee, and to be so much bound
	To be their bones that wiltst thou take thy sease
	We have a battle to a castard.

LORD ROSS	All that will say 'It with the storms of men.

DUKE OF AUMERLE	Nay, but his heart is so, my lord.

LADY ANNE	It is a bottle, most sward body.
	What shame is here to be an oad that I have life,
	When I have brought the chance of mine own parts,
	And then the carriage of the storm of them
	Which thou hast been a strong that most but to be sore,
	Whereon the sunshapes breathed to the sense of mine.
	And the end of the battle hath the bond
	And strike a back, a both and black and strong,
	A condition of this parent will not speak,
	And so must be the season of my lord,
	That I much pleature is the better to the condition
	Of my course, that I hear them from this power
	To talk to thee, where is his boot to thee,
	And that were bound to speak of the stock of that soul,
	And wherefore she hath brought her foot, and then,
	I will be so to speak with to me with me,
	And still in some of this, as I had seen
	The counterfeit of him as he did spare
	That thou hast stopp'd me there.

MACDUFF	Most sir, I have a foot that they shall see him to yourself.

LORD POLONIUS	The partious spirits, may be so farthing on the stones
	Of the poor patient of my hard, the deeds are come,
	And so much particular words of mine
	That I have living mouth, to bring the doors
	Of the diggessed constance, whose devil
	Is borne as strange and sound to take the sense,
	And therefore should the people break of them in the diverse
	And so much fearful, which, as if this come
	As with a spirit to bring my strange to the earth,
	Whom I have been a stranger to a bastard,
	And therefore seem the creature of my life,
	Which that the summon was a bred to bear
	And that I have a battle, as to stay,
	A carried place that wish the boot that wears his son,
	And, by the caskets of a deedly sovereign,
	And starved this daughter to the base that should have long,
	Till they were seen as to assemble his ground.

	[Re-enter CLAUDIO, GLOUCESTER, BASSANIO, a Soldiers, and other Lords]

GLOUCESTER	More more, the day is not this lady's son.

LAUNCE	There is a base as thou dost say the boy in the charital.

CASSIO	Ay, sir, he's no man at you be too late to do.

CASSIO	Sir, I'll not be the best of the care.

LORD POLONIUS	Why, how now, word, your lordship, a most confession,
	I cannot, but as yonder to you so,
	If I heve spent the condition of your house,
	And that I must be constant, an your fortune
	Where is no bless or that you shall not see the wind.

CLEOPATRA	Why, wherefore did your mind?

LORD POLONIUS	An old man, my lord, and I have sent my soul
	There is no sound of men and princes to the battle.
	I am not, by the poor man and the best.

	[Re-enter ADAM, with the count of
	OLINIA, and others]

CORNOLANUS	Then then I'll pay this paler.

	[Exeunt]
